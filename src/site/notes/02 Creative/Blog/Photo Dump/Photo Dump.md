## Why Here?
I've always wanted to participate in instagram. and for a time, in small doses, I did. But as I've become more conscious of the greater picture and the niche that instagram holds, I've been wary of uploading any data to their platform. I deleted the app from my phone and when I reinstalled it to make a mutual aid post for a friend I found myself barraged with notifications for an ex. It is now blatantly obvious to me that platforms like instagram, facebook, and youtube are just propaganda. To make you depressed, anxious, hopeless. Whatever stops you from doing something about it. I would love to live in a world where computers actually helped us come together, but that is not the world we live in.  So when bluesky announced that they are going to concede to the new EU regulations requiring every user that wishes to upload any sort of nudity whatsovere to submit their governemt documents I knew that I needed to move all my pictures somewhere else. That place is now here :)
## Ground Rules
- These images are not to be taken and used without my permission.
- Do not be a dick.
- Nudity will be mixed in intermittently and I will not attempt to censor it. Nudity is not sexual, bodies are not sexual. A culture uncomfortable with nudity is a culture uncomfortable with bodies, and we're made of those, probably a good idea to not be afraid of them.
- I am not above IP banning you if you are weird, you too can be free from fascism by posting your nudes, (or being naked, I'm currently writing this 100% nude sitting in the mid july morning sun)
- fuck the rules, stop the hoopla, free palastine.

### Car Pic and distortion
There's something I've always liked about this sort of camera distortion. digital sensors in low light have a really hard time getting enough data, so they sort of freak out, or the compression creates artifacts, or in this case; the exposure gets all wonky when you shake the camera.

I love the far side very much, my dad died when I was 2 years old, but I still catch glimpses of him. He left a few comic books around and the far side was one of them. The Far Side is so stupid and it holds a special place in my heart <3

tysm for reading and/or enjoying the pictures, I hope you are well and cozy and loving yourself.

Adios,
Lewa ~ ♡

## About me!
I'm a 25 year old [[02 Creative/Blog/Lewa's Bio#Gender\|nonbinary]] artist in pursuit of understanding understanding itself, that is my mission. I am quite passionate about art, learning, archivism, and hedonism. I'm gonna try to start moving into this blog more. Social Media has so far been a failed experiment and I wish to carve out a place for myself that feels like it's actually mine!

## Gender
I'd describe my found gender as something between a Fae and a Nonbinary Fem. I'm not nearly as concerned about the words, although I do have a very fun time expressing myself with them! gender is not as simple as changing what words you use. If you'd like to be more gender affirming, then I ask you to consider how you may treat men and women differently and eliminate that process when you interact with me.
#### Fae/Faer/Faem
Fae, (as in the germanic root for faerie) pronounced like "they", "Faer" like "their", "Faem" like "game". To be honest I just sort of plug them in wherever they fit, I wouldn't worry too hard about it.
#### They/Them/Theirs
Do I even need to explain it?

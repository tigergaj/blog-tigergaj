I often feel bad

very often, in fact

I'm fact, much of the time I spend breathing is spent feeling bad

I want to feel better, I want to blossom and grow like I've been told I will

But I'm stuck.

I'm stuck thinking about one brief magical moment.

that was the peak, I'd not felt better than that in my entire life, and I may never feel it again. and that makes me sad again.

For one brief magical moment

I was safe, I was warm

in the warmth of the sun
in the gaze of the moon

I was loved

For one brief magical moment

crying feels good

crying let's me know that I am feeling

crying let's me know I will be okay

I can only cry when I feel safe

crying is when I feel the love of myself rushing in

crying is when I know that things are at their worst, and it's only uphill from here

crying says that life is not hopeless 

crying says that this world sees you

crying is the best feeling there is

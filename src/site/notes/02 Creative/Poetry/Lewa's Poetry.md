crying feels good

crying let's me know that I am not an emotionless golem

crying let's me know I will be okay

I am safe when I cry

crying is when I feel the love of myself rushing in

crying is when I know that things are at their worst, and it's only uphill from here

crying says that life is not hopeless 

crying says that this world sees me and that I am a part of it

crying is the best feeling there is

I often feel bad, very often, in fact.
In fact, much of the time I spend breathing is spent feeling bad.

I want to feel better, I want to blossom and grow like I've been told I will.
But I'm stuck.
I'm stuck thinking about one brief magical moment.

that was the peak, I'd not felt better than that in my entire life, 
and I am scared that I'll never feel it again, and then I am sad

for one brief magic moment
I was safe, I was warm
in the warmth of the sun
in the gaze of the moon
I was loved
for one brief magic moment

I don't know if that moment will ever come back
maybe I've felt the most I'll ever feel

Let me ask you a riddle

I often wonder why I don't cry more
I was born a happy child
I feel so strongly, all the time

what am I? 

I wonder why I didn't cry today
raised by someone with a piece missing
anger, sadness, grief, love, pain, hate

what am I? 

I wonder why I'm not crying now.
I feel like I have a piece missing
I feel alone

what am I?

She was more than enough for me
but for her, perhaps I was too much

here one moment, gone the next

oh, billy, watch out
momma's got a stick
momma's got a stick

momma said to me "I got a stick,
how should I beat you?"

oh billy, watch out
teacher's got a book
teacher's got a book

teacher said "I got a book,
how should I teach you?"

oh billy, watch out
billy watch out

oh billy watch out,
pah's got a gun
pah's got a gun

oh billy watch out
go and break momma's stick, break momma's stick
oh billy watch out
read the teacher's book, read the teacher's book
oh billy watch out
throw the gun in a lake, throw that gun in a lake
oh bily watch out

Nobody loves me like you do
but you're long gone and now
I'll have to love myself like she loved me

a long time I've been searching for someone like you
when I found you it felt like coming home
when I lost you I felt like I didn't belong
so if by the time I see you next
I'm sorry if I'm with someone like you

healing is exercising my fucking body and shouting from the rooftops that I'm broken

The birds continue singing
*deep down some part of me is garbled and screaming*
The sun keeps setting
*Every time I stop to think, I become paralyzed*
The birds continue singing
*If she couldn't love me, maybe I'm worthless*
The trail remains unwalked
*I'm hungry, but eating won't make me feel better*
Another moon
*often on the verge of tears but unable to let it out*
The grass continues growing
*I don't know what I want anymore*
The raspberries continue tasting sweet
*I'm scared*
The birds continue singing

All I want in my heart of hearts is some precious creature to cast my love on
*too flowery*
All I want in my heart of hearts is some precious creature to stab my love into
*too selfish*
seeing your smile makes my heart flutter every time
*true, but is it what I wanna say?*

it is not our responsibility as lover to quantify our love, but rather, it's our responsibility to make other creatures feel love. give back to that wild kindness,? give it all back. It will take it one way or another.

A pretty thing looking up at me before kissing feels warm like the sunset.

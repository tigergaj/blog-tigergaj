## Who is the Monster?
please click on the headers to read the letter and come back for a bit of an explanation. these letters were constructed for the purpose of psychoanalyzing The Monster (otherwise known as the person who gave birth to me.) I've seen other people healing from narcissistic parents refuse to call them parents anymore ([TheraminTrees](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ-vHE5CrGaL_ITEg-n3OeA|TheraminTrees) comes to mind) and I think that it's an effective compartmentalization for people who have been so deeply scarred by a person that forced you to be in this world. Why bother living at all if you can't reasonably be kind to your own damn kid? anyways, I've taken to calling her The Monster, and I have edited th text to reflect that.

## you always do
I'd had breasts for months, I'd surely been topless in front of her before this and

in my [[life/Diary/Diary#2025-06-18\|diary]], I wrote this about it: 

*~I'm other news I'm feeling quite good about this whole writing thing. [[life/Letters/A series of Letters to The Monster\|The Monster]] confronted me about my body when she saw me walking around outside topless last weekend and it was an unproductive conversation and didn't help her understand anything. it bothered me so much that she clearly didn't get it so I wrote [[A series of Letters to The Monster/you always do\|you always do]]. I don't know if it will help her understand, but I just sent it to her and we had this interaction. she has to solve my funny saw trap in order to get the reward of me telling her I despise her guts and think she's a coward. ![Screenshot_20250618-132717.png](/img/user/Screenshot_20250618-132717.png)
we'll see if she fucking gets any of this."*

 still think [[A series of Letters to The Monster/you always do\|you always do]] is the best thing I've ever written. it's honestly a crying shame that it was wasted on such a waste of perfectly good brain cells.
## [[A series of Letters to The Monster/Encouragement\|Encouragement]]
it was 3 weeks of my mom refusing to figure out how to read my note. the two weeks she came back (I live in her house and she comes down on the weekends btw) she basically yelled at me for me not making it easy for her (yes, she really admitted that trying to open a text files is hard, I helped her way more than I even intended tbh).

but seeing as she hadn't opened the first one, I figured I'd apply pressume on her to read it, so I made another note and sent it to her. ironically, I don't think she even read it. perhaps she didn't notice it, but more probably; she ignored it cuz she was lazy or any other bullshit reason a narc could condure.

that bit about her not interacting with me is important. You can tell that she's not actually talking to *you*. there is a disconnection in her communication, because there needs to be. she does?kt understand that I don't live in her world. she is denying me the common courtesy of *actually* engaging because if she does that, then she'll find a person with a soul. And we'll get to why she can't have that later on.

and those bits from Alan Watts are from a nearly three hour lecture titled "The individual and the world". this talk seems to have inspired me to write my next two letters as well. but this idea of my mom distancing herself from actually interacting with me; Alan watts talks about how you need to understand things outside of you to truly understand who you are. people, cultures, places, religons. they all have their place in the world and if you only set out to understand just one thing (as narcissists often do) then you don't actually understand anything. Someone like that has trapped themselves outside of the world! they have detached from all this beauty, all this sorrow, all these people and places and religons so on and so forth. it's all meaningless to a narcissist, because they're not here.

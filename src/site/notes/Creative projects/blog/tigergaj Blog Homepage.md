## Howdy!
My name is Lewa, I'm a 25 year old queer artist with way too dang many thoughts that I've just let everyone know exist before I die.

## I've been looking at this person in the mirror
But I haven't taken any pictures of them. I've been constantly thinking about the subjectivity of gender and I'm gonna be honest, the more I detach myself from it, the happier I am.

## It feels good to accept what I see 

*"I am whatever that is"*, I'll accept that I am that creature looking back at itself, 0.0000000061 seconds in the past. I could not predict the future, but I am in this moment, and the next time I look in a mirror the person looking back at me will be different. 

Maybe another burn mark, maybe a haircut that the person writing this enjoys, maybe not. We all have things that we like and dislike about our bodies, and it's not fair to the person in your mirror if you do not accept them. There are things that we cannot change, and that is simply the bedrock of reality. Focus on the things that you can change, the person you could tangibly be. 

And the person in the present will love the person in the mirror, because that is the only thing left to do.

## Come Out
Currently, I am mainly building my website to host [[Come out.canvas|Come out]]. It is a project that I have to do for a number of reasons. It contains both the answers I've found and the explanation of how I found them. I've put a lot of effort into this and there's just no other way it could possibly be. My philosophy is imbued into the fabric of this project and I really need everyone to know that I would not be asking you to listen if I did not think it to be important. There's a lot of ground to cover and we all have a lot to learn. thank you for taking the time to indulge my reality. 

for now, I only have one note for you! I hope it will do :)

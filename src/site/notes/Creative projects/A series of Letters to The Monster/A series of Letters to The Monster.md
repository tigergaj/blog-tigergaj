## Who is the Monster?
please use the directory to read the letters and come back for a bit of an explanation. these letters were constructed for the purpose of psychoanalyzing The Monster (otherwise known as the person who gave birth to me.) I've seen other people healing from narcissistic parents refuse to call them parents anymore ([TheraminTrees](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ-vHE5CrGaL_ITEg-n3OeA|TheraminTrees) comes to mind) and I think that it's an effective compartmentalization for people who have been so deeply scarred by a person that forced you to be in this world. Why bother living at all if you can't reasonably be kind to your own damn kid? anyways, I've taken to calling her The Monster, and I have 
edited out all mention of her as "mom" to reflect that

## you always do
I'd had breasts for months, I'd surely been topless in front of her before this and

in my [[life/Diary/Diary#2025-06-18\|diary]], I wrote this about it: 

*I'm other news I'm feeling quite good about this whole writing thing. [[Creative projects/A series of Letters to The Monster/A series of Letters to The Monster\|The Monster]] confronted me about my body when she saw me walking around outside topless last weekend and it was an unproductive conversation and didn't help her understand anything. it bothered me so much that she clearly didn't get it so I wrote [[Creative projects/A series of Letters to The Monster/you always do\|you always do]]. I don't know if it will help her understand, but I just sent it to her and we had this interaction. she has to solve my funny saw trap in order to get the reward of me telling her I despise her guts and think she's a coward. ![Screenshot_20250618-132717.png](/img/user/Screenshot_20250618-132717.png)
we'll see if she fucking gets any of this.*

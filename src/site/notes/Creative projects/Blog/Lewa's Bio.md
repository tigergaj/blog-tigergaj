## About me!
I'm a 25 year old queer artist in pursuit of understanding understanding itself, that is my mission. I am quite passionate about art, anarchism, learning, and enjoying living my life as much as possible. I'm gonna try to start moving into this blog more. I really cannot fucking stand the social media shit anymore.

## Gender
#### Fae/Faer/Faem
Fae, as in the germanic root for faerie pronounced like they, Faer like their, Faem like game
#### They/Them/Theirs
ol' reliable


I would describe my found gender as something between a Fae and a Nonbinary Fem. I'm not nearly as concerned about the words, although I do have a very fun time expressing myself with them! gender is not as simple as changing what words you use. if you'd like to be more gender affirming, just ask, you'll figure it out! I don't wish to carve your gender into stone, nothing will last for eternity, neither will my gender. The long answer can be found in [[Creative projects/Shelved Projects/Come Out/Come Out/Frameworks/my thing with being nonbinary\|my thing with being nonbinary]] (coming soon, pretty proud of this one actually)

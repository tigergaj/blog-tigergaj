### Howdy!
My name is Lewa, I'm a 25 year old queer artist(?) with way too dang many thoughts that I need to share because healing is shouting from the rooftops that I'm broken. I hope that at the very least, if I could not touch anyone with this writing in the present, I hope that it touches someone... somewhere... someday...
### About Me:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




### Pronouns
- Fae/Faer/Faem They/Them/Theirs
### Gender
I would describe my found gender as something between a Fae and a Nonbinary Fem. I'm not nearly as concerned about the gender itself, but rather that people understand that it's not useful to carve one into stone. that is a useless idea. nothing will last for eternity, neither will my gender.

The short answer is that gender is a social construct designed to control populations of people. The most powerful [[Creative projects/Come Out/Come Out/Power Structures\|Power Structures]] make sure to utilize it.

The long answer can be found at [[Creative projects/Come Out/Come Out/I ask that you understand/I ask you to understand\|I ask you to understand]]

[[#Ground Rules]]

## Why Here?
I've always wanted to participate in instagram. and for a time, in small doses, I did. But as I've becme more conscious of the greater picture and the niche that instagram holds, I've been wary of uploading any data to their platform. I deleted the app from my phone and when I reinstalled it to make a mutual aid post for a friend I found myself barraged with notifications for a person I talked to in the DMs for about a month. It is now blatantly obvious to me that platforms like instagram, facebook, and youtube are just propaganda. To make you depressed, anxious, hopeless. Whatever stops you from doing something about it. I would love to live in a world where computers actually helped us come together, but that is not the world we live in.  So when bluesky announced that they are going to concede to the new EU regulations requiring every user that wishes to upload any sort of nudity whatsovere to submit their governemt documents I knew that I needed to make this.
## Ground Rules
- These images are not to be taken and used without my permission.
- Do not be a dick.
- Nudity will be mixed in intermittently and I will not attempt to censor it. Nudity is not sexual, bodies are not sexual. A culture uncomfortable with nudity is a culture uncomfortable with bodies, and we're made of those. Probably a good idea to not be afraid of them.
- I am not above IP banning you if you are weird, you too can be free from fascism by posting your nudes, (or being naked, I'm currently writing this 100% nude sitting in the mid july morning sun)
- fuck the rules, stop the hoopla, free palastine.

## Come Out
Currently, I am mainly building my website to host [[Come out.canvas|Come out]]. It is a project that I have to do for a number of reasons. It contains both the answers I've found and the explanation of how I found them. I've put a lot of effort into this and there's just no other way it could possibly be. My philosophy is imbued into the fabric of this project and I really need everyone to know that I would not be asking you to listen if I did not think it to be important. There's a lot of ground to cover and we all have a lot to learn. thank you for taking the time to indulge my reality.

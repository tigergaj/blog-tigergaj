## About me!
I'm a 25 year old [[Creative projects/Blog/Lewa's Bio#Gender\|nonbinary]] artist in pursuit of understanding understanding itself, that is my mission. I am quite passionate about art, learning, archivism, and enjoying living my life as much as possible. I'm gonna try to start moving into this blog more. Social Media has so far been a failed experiment

## Gender
#### Fae/Faer/Faem
Fae, as in the germanic root for faerie pronounced like they, Faer like their, Faem like game
#### They/Them/Theirs
ol' reliable


I would describe my found gender as something between a Fae and a Nonbinary Fem. I'm not nearly as concerned about the words, although I do have a very fun time expressing myself with them! gender is not as simple as changing what words you use. If you'd like to be more gender affirming, just ask, you'll figure it out! I don't wish to carve my gender into stone, nothing will last for eternity, neither will my gender. The long answer can be found in [[Creative projects/Shelved Projects/Come Out/Come Out/Frameworks/my thing with being nonbinary\|my thing with being nonbinary]] (coming soon, pretty proud of this one actually)

## Philosophyüí≠ & Learning üß†
I am a prophet of [[Creative projects/Shelved Projects/Come Out/Come Out/Virtues/Wholisticism\|wholisticism]], and I like learning as much as I possibly can all the time more than anything. So if you can teach me something, shoot me a message!

### Art that I make üìùü•ü
I like to write as my primary medium of expression. I've been experimenting with [[Lewa Poems\|poetry]] as of late. but I am mostly obsessed with writing because being good at it gives me the power to put my experiences to words and I love words. I'm still dealing with the question of what to publish, so sorry if I'm a little reserved with my writing at the moment, it's sort of my thought baby if you think about it ü§èüèª.

I also love cooking, and I plan on getting better at doing recipes, but feel free to ask me about anything and everything food cuz I love to talk about it! fav meal is homemade pierogi with a fat dollop of sour cream and fresh dill to garnish.

### Art that I consume
It's fair to say that at this moment I'm still absorbing. I may never stop absorbing at this rate and it feels good so I will keep doing it either way

## Come Out
Currently, I am mainly building my website to host [[Come out.canvas|Come out]]. It is a project that I have to do for a number of reasons. It contains both the answers I've found and the explanation of how I found them. I've put a lot of effort into this and there's just no other way it could possibly be. My philosophy is imbued into the fabric of this project and I really need everyone to know that I would not be asking you to listen if I did not think it to be important. There's a lot of ground to cover and we all have a lot to learn. thank you for taking the time to indulge my reality.

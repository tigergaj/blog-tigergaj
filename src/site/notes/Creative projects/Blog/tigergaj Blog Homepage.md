### Howdy!
My name is Lewa, I'm a 25 year old queer artist(?) with way too dang many thoughts that I need to share because healing is shouting from the rooftops that I'm broken. I hope that at the very least, if I could not touch anyone with this writing in the present, I hope that it touches someone... somewhere... someday...

## About me!
I'm a 25 year old queer artist in pursuit of understanding understanding itself, that is my mission. I am quite passionate about art, anarchism, learning, and enjoying living my life as much as possible. I'm gonna try to start moving into this blog more. I really cannot fucking stand the social media shit anymore.

## Gender
#### Fae/Faer/Faem
Fae, as in the germanic root for faerie pronounced like they, Faer like their, Faem like game
#### They/Them/Theirs
ol' reliable


I would describe my found gender as something between a Fae and a Nonbinary Fem. I'm not nearly as concerned about the words, although I do have a very fun time expressing myself with them! gender is not as simple as changing what words you use. if you'd like to be more gender affirming, just ask, you'll figure it out! I don't wish to carve your gender into stone, nothing will last for eternity, neither will my gender. The long answer can be found in [[Creative projects/Shelved Projects/Come Out/Come Out/Frameworks/my thing with being nonbinary\|my thing with being nonbinary]] (coming soon, pretty proud of this one actually)

## Why Here?
I've always wanted to participate in instagram. and for a time, in small doses, I did. But as I've becme more conscious of the greater picture and the niche that instagram holds, I've been wary of uploading any data to their platform. I deleted the app from my phone and when I reinstalled it to make a mutual aid post for a friend I found myself barraged with notifications for a person I talked to in the DMs for about a month. It is now blatantly obvious to me that platforms like instagram, facebook, and youtube are just propaganda. To make you depressed, anxious, hopeless. Whatever stops you from doing something about it. I would love to live in a world where computers actually helped us come together, but that is not the world we live in.  So when bluesky announced that they are going to concede to the new EU regulations requiring every user that wishes to upload any sort of nudity whatsovere to submit their governemt documents I knew that I needed to make this.
## Ground Rules
- These images are not to be taken and used without my permission.
- Do not be a dick.
- Nudity will be mixed in intermittently and I will not attempt to censor it. Nudity is not sexual, bodies are not sexual. A culture uncomfortable with nudity is a culture uncomfortable with bodies, and we're made of those, probably a good idea to not be afraid of them.
- I am not above IP banning you if you are weird, you too can be free from fascism by posting your nudes, (or being naked, I'm currently writing this 100% nude sitting in the mid july morning sun)
- fuck the rules, stop the hoopla, free palastine.

## Come Out
Currently, I am mainly building my website to host [[Come out.canvas|Come out]]. It is a project that I have to do for a number of reasons. It contains both the answers I've found and the explanation of how I found them. I've put a lot of effort into this and there's just no other way it could possibly be. My philosophy is imbued into the fabric of this project and I really need everyone to know that I would not be asking you to listen if I did not think it to be important. There's a lot of ground to cover and we all have a lot to learn. thank you for taking the time to indulge my reality.
